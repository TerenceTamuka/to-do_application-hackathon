## Planning

A GitHub Project with linked Issues was used as the Agile tool for this project. User Stories with acceptance criteria were defined using GitHub Issues and development of code for these stories was managed using a Kanban board. All of the User Stories were linked to a 'parent' Epic issue to show how they all supported the over-arching goal of the project. The acceptance criteria were tested as each story moved to 'Done' and were also included in the final pre-submission manual testing documented in the Testing section of this README.

The Epic, User Stories and Kanban board can be accessed here : [My To-Do Management Agile Tool](https://github.com/users/TerenceTamuka/projects/6)
